        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-elf/">Half-Elf</a>

        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf/">Dwarf</a>
          -- Stoudy and sturdy, Dwarves are naturally wise creatures, though typically not Charismatic. This makes them natural choices for front-line warriors.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling/">Halfling</a>
          -- Based on the classic hobbits, Halflings are quick and Charismatic creatures that are naturally less strong than their larger allies. They make natural warriors based off of speed.</li>

          -- Sturdy, loveable, and physically weak, Gnomes are incredibly small, but creative and eccentric beings.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc/">Half-Orc</a>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/">General Feats</a>
          -- The general feats include a number of feats that help to improve your character in general ways, usually statistically or outside of combat, allowing for more
          creative roleplaying abilities, and skill bonuses. In addition, many of the feats allow you to gain more abilities relative to your class -- extra abilites or per day use
          of class skills. For skill focused classes, Skill Focus is good for giving a massive increase to one skill in particular. Most the feats are specific, and should only be
          used to supplement onto other feats and skills, rather than standing on their own.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/">Combat Feats</a>
          -- Combat feats are where the most useful feats are often found; some are even nearly required for playing certain play styles. Some important feats include;
          <ol>
            <li>Power Attack -- This allows take a minus to your to hit in order to deal massive damage; exceptionally good for fighters, particularly two-handed weapons, such as Greatswords or Greataxes.</li>
            <li>Two-Weapon Fighting -- This allows you to wield two weapons at once, at a small minus to each of their attacks.</li>
            <li>Weapon Finesse -- This allows you to add your Dexterity Modifer to your to hit roll instead of your Strength bonus, making Dexterity based builds possible.</li>
            <li>Combat Reflexes -- This allows you to make multiple attacks of opportuntiy a round, forcing your opponents into staying in one place, and making them easier to surround.</li>
            <li>Point-Black Shot -- This is the start of a chain of ranged attacks that improve ranged attacks and remove many of the penalties of range.</li>
            <li>Weapon Focus -- This gives you a bonus to a particular weapon, and can be combined with feats such as Weapon Specialization to become devestating with a particular weapon -- particularly as a Fighter.</li>
          </ol>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/">Item Creation Feats</a>
          -- Item Creation feats are incredibly complicated, and shouldn't be used for a first time campaign. The basic principle is that you give up a number of funds and xp in order to create powerful items,
          often requiring a magical background and a number of invested feats.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/">Metamagic Feats</a>
          -- Metamagic feats work differently for all magic classes, but the shared factor between all the metamagic feats is that you use a higher level spell slot to cast a lower level spell with empowered effects.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/racial-feats/">Racial Feats</a>
          -- Racial feats are small bonuses that are only available to certain races and often increase the number of times a race-based ability can be activated.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/feat-tree/">Feat Tree</a>
          -- This feat tree includes all feats, and also shows what feats lead towards other feats, and is a good resource for planning a character that you'll be playing over
          an extended period of time.</li>

      <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="resourcestext">
      <p>Skills are abilities that all players have -- some just have more than others. Based on your class, you'll have a number of <b>class skills</b>, or skills that come natural to your character.
        When you use a skill point in a class skill, you immediately gain a +3 bonus to every check made with that skill -- so particularly early game, your class is almost half of what skills you end up using.
        Every level, you get a certain number of skill points, effected by your class and your intelligence bonus. For example, a Fighter only gets 2 skill points plus their intelligence bonus each level,
        where a rogue gets 8 plus intelligence -- giving rogues significantly more flexibility in the skills they choose to specialize in. You can read in detail about skills in general
        <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>There are a number of skills, each with their own uses in and out of combat. A lot of the time, it's up to the player to elect to use their skills, and sometimes the DM will ignore certain skills
        altogether; I personally pay no need to the Diplomacy skill, instead forcing my players to convince the NPC they're speaking to through role-playing; but every DM will be different, and it's good
        to know what your DM's opinon on certain skills are.</p>
      <p>The different skills are;</p>
