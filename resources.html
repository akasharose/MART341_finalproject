        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human/" target="_blank">Human</a>
          -- The most typical race, effective at playing almost any class.</li>

          -- A classic elven race; boasts incredible dexterity and intelligence, while also frail creatures, with a low constitution.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-elf/" target="_blank">Half-Elf</a>
          -- Half-Elf, and typically half-human as well, half-elves gain some of the benefits of being elven, while keeping the ability to be effective at any and all classes.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf/" target="_blank">Dwarf</a>
          -- Stoudy and sturdy, Dwarves are naturally wise creatures, though typically not Charismatic. This makes them natural choices for front-line warriors.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling/" target="_blank">Halfling</a>
          -- Based on the classic hobbits, Halflings are quick and Charismatic creatures that are naturally less strong than their larger allies. They make natural warriors based off of speed.</li>

          -- Sturdy, loveable, and physically weak, Gnomes are incredibly small, but creative and eccentric beings.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/" target="_blank">General Feats</a>
          -- The general feats include a number of feats that help to improve your character in general ways, usually statistically or outside of combat, allowing for more
          creative roleplaying abilities, and skill bonuses. In addition, many of the feats allow you to gain more abilities relative to your class -- extra abilites or per day use
          of class skills. For skill focused classes, Skill Focus is good for giving a massive increase to one skill in particular. Most the feats are specific, and should only be
          used to supplement onto other feats and skills, rather than standing on their own.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/" target="_blank">Combat Feats</a>
          -- Combat feats are where the most useful feats are often found; some are even nearly required for playing certain play styles. Some important feats include;
          <ol>
            <li>Power Attack -- This allows take a minus to your to hit in order to deal massive damage; exceptionally good for fighters, particularly two-handed weapons, such as Greatswords or Greataxes.</li>
            <li>Two-Weapon Fighting -- This allows you to wield two weapons at once, at a small minus to each of their attacks.</li>
            <li>Weapon Finesse -- This allows you to add your Dexterity Modifer to your to hit roll instead of your Strength bonus, making Dexterity based builds possible.</li>
            <li>Combat Reflexes -- This allows you to make multiple attacks of opportuntiy a round, forcing your opponents into staying in one place, and making them easier to surround.</li>
            <li>Point-Black Shot -- This is the start of a chain of ranged attacks that improve ranged attacks and remove many of the penalties of range.</li>
            <li>Weapon Focus -- This gives you a bonus to a particular weapon, and can be combined with feats such as Weapon Specialization to become devestating with a particular weapon -- particularly as a Fighter.</li>
          </ol>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/" target="_blank">Item Creation Feats</a>
          -- Item Creation feats are incredibly complicated, and shouldn't be used for a first time campaign. The basic principle is that you give up a number of funds and xp in order to create powerful items,
          often requiring a magical background and a number of invested feats.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/" target="_blank">Metamagic Feats</a>
          -- Metamagic feats work differently for all magic classes, but the shared factor between all the metamagic feats is that you use a higher level spell slot to cast a lower level spell with empowered effects.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/racial-feats/" target="_blank">Racial Feats</a>
          -- Racial feats are small bonuses that are only available to certain races and often increase the number of times a race-based ability can be activated.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/feat-tree/" target="_blank">Feat Tree</a>
          -- This feat tree includes all feats, and also shows what feats lead towards other feats, and is a good resource for planning a character that you'll be playing over
          an extended period of time.</li>

      <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="resourcestext">
      <p>Skills are abilities that all players have -- some just have more than others. Based on your class, you'll have a number of <b>class skills</b>, or skills that come natural to your character.
        When you use a skill point in a class skill, you immediately gain a +3 bonus to every check made with that skill -- so particularly early game, your class is almost half of what skills you end up using.
        Every level, you get a certain number of skill points, effected by your class and your intelligence bonus. For example, a Fighter only gets 2 skill points plus their intelligence bonus each level,
        where a rogue gets 8 plus intelligence -- giving rogues significantly more flexibility in the skills they choose to specialize in. You can read in detail about skills in general
        <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>There are a number of skills, each with their own uses in and out of combat. A lot of the time, it's up to the player to elect to use their skills, and sometimes the DM will ignore certain skills
        altogether; I personally pay no need to the Diplomacy skill, instead forcing my players to convince the NPC they're speaking to through role-playing; but every DM will be different, and it's good
        to know what your DM's opinon on certain skills are.</p>
      <p>The different skills are;</p>

          -- This allows your character to try and pick up on other characters bluffs, or try and pick out someone's motivation. Check with your DM to see if this is a mechanic they plan to use.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sleight-of-hand/" target="_blank">Sleight of Hand</a>
          -- This allows your character to hide weapons or pickpocket.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/spellcraft/" target="_blank">Spellcraft</a>
          -- This allows your character to begin to identify different types of magic, often to try and glean the power behind a rival mage or the nature of a magic item.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth/" target="_blank">Stealth</a>
          -- This allows your character to attempt to remain hidden from sight, usually rolling against an enemy's perception.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival/" target="_blank">Survival</a>
          -- This allows your character to survive in the wilderness, as well as allowing them the ability to track quarry of any nature over long distances.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim/" target="_blank">Swim</a>
          -- This allows your character to (get this) swim.</li>

          -- This allows a non-magical character to use magic items that they would otherwise not be able to use (such as wands, rods, etc.).</li>

    <div class="resourcestext">
      <p>Naturally, everyone needs equipment to make their characters function; armor to keep the character alive, and weapons to help deal damage, as well as much more -- depending on
        how the DM chooses to run things. If they want to go fully realistic, the Pathfinder system goes into full detail on rations and carry weight. Other than that, equipment is a key
        part of any Dungeons and Dragons campaign.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/" target="_blank">Weapons</a>
          -- No character is complete without a sword in hand; there are plenty of weapons to look through, each with their own special and unique abilites.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor/" target="_blank">Armor</a>
          -- Not every character will use armor, though; in return for a boost to your Armor Class, you often loose a small amount of mobility, gain some difficulties casting certain types of magic, and can't use Dexterity quite as much. However, with the right character, a good set of armor can make the difference between life and death.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/" target="_blank">Goods and Services</a>
          -- Some DM's don't want to deal with this section, but it can allow for some fantastic roleplaying and creativity. Rope, food, clothing, disguise kits, lockpicking tools; everything an adventure would want besides weapons and armor is found in here.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials/" target="_blank">Special Materials</a>
          -- Certain monsters have damage resistance to most weapons, with usually one weakness. Werewolfs, for example, take reduced damage from everything not made of silver. To create a weapon or a set of armor or something unique, check through these pages to find what the additional requirements of the items are.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/" target="_blank">Magic Items</a>
          -- By far the most complicated section of equipment, Magical Items fall under one of two categories. The first is a general magical enchancement, usually put on weapons and armor to increase the basic effect of the item. Second are specific magic items, of which there are two many to count. As your level increases and you gain power, magic items are all but required to keep the characters powerful enough to face off against some of the more powerful monstrosities in the world.</li>

      <p>This section is only for the Dungeon Master, or anyone interested in looking at stats. Though making every creature your group is going to fight is a possibility, Pathfinder has
        thousands of differnt monsters already designed and balanced for parties still fighting a small group of goblins, to parties killing Satan himself. The monsters are ranked by race,
        as well as <b>Challenge Rating</b>, also known as CR. For reference, the CR is meant to represent what level a group of four standard adventurers will need to be to fight one of these monsters.
        For example, A Common Basilisk is CR 5, which means a party of 4 players should be able to fight the Basilisk without being too overwhelmed, but without just waltzing through it. Based off of
        your party's composition and stats, as well as your player's experience in combat, the amount of difficult enemies you'll be able to throw at them will change -- always be aware of your party's
        strength, and read up on the monsters you plan to use ahead of time.</p>

      <p>Some monsters are certainly easier to use than others -- here's a recommendation of one monster in particular from every CR that I find works well for a beginning party, as well as things to be
        aware of.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin/" target="_blank">Goblin: CR 1/3</a>
          -- Goblins make for fantastic enemies for starting your campaign against. They're not too strong, iconic, and are easy to create small and short dungeons to start your party off on their adventure.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul/" target="_blank">Ghoul: CR 1</a>
          -- A classic undead foe, these zombified beings can be quite difficult for a lew level party -- but can be an intimidating horde at higher levels as well.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/bugbear/" target="_blank">Bugbear: CR 2</a>
          -- Usually the leaders of Goblins and Hobgoblins, Bugbears can function as an excellent first boss encounter for an early party.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/hell-hound/" target="_blank">Hell Hound: CR 3</a>
          -- These demonic dogs can help supplement demonic foes when the party is around level 5-7; adding two hell hounds into a boss fight with a more powerful devil can add a massive level of tension into an already insane battle.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/mimic/" target="_blank">Mimic: CR 4</a>
          -- Everyone loves chests; Mimics are just a way to make the party afraid of even the most simple items. If your party is just smashing through everything, a Mimic might be able to convince them to slow down.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/troll/" target="_blank">Troll: CR 5</a>
          -- Trolls are an enormous amount of fun. Classic in fantasy lore, and difficult enemies that require more strategy than just 'stab it until it dies', Trolls are an excellent enemy type.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/clockwork/clockwork-soldier/" target="_blank">Clockwork Soldier: CR 6</a>
          -- These are some of the first major constructs a party can encounter; and they're some of the most vicious. Use this soldier sparringly -- espeically as a guardian of a more powerful mage, a Clockwork Solider is a terrifying creature.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/chimera/" target="_blank">Chimera: CR 7</a>
          -- Another staple of the fantasy genre, Chimera's a huge, stand-alone monsters that your players feel awesome taking down. It seems unbeatable, but it's a fantastically balanced mosnter.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/genie/efreeti/" target="_blank">Efreeti: CR 8</a>
          -- Efreeti can make phenominal main villains during an early arc of the campaign. Powerful, magical, but not squishy, Efreeti can serve a DM in quite a few ways.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/vampire/" target="_blank">Vampire: CR 9</a>
          -- Another contender for possible main villain, Vampires are classic antagonists in Dungeons and Dragons games. There's also a template that allows you to make a Vampire of any level -- but the standard model is built for level 9.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/rakshasa/rakshasa-common/" target="_blank">Rakshasa: CR 10</a>
          -- Grotesque, graceful, ruthless, and powerful, Rakshasa are phenominal monsters; they're easy to use in most campaigns, either as a group the party needs to stop, or as the left hand of a mid-game villain.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/thunderbird/" target="_blank">Thunderbird: CR 11</a>
          -- Powerful, deadly, and a being of the skies, the Thunderbird is another phenominal creature that can be used as a target for hunting, a creature to save, or whatever else you can come up with.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/purple-worm/" target="_blank">Purple Worm: CR 12</a>
          -- A classic Dungeons and Dragons beast, the Purple Worm is a gargantuan enemy, meaning that the party can very quickly feel small. If you want a party to feel like they've killed something incredibly powerful, the Purple Worm is an age old choice.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/golem/golem-iron/" target="_blank">Iron Golem: CR 13</a>
          -- Returning back to the world of Constructs, Iron Golems are the basic physical soldiers. Heavy armor, high damage, and difficult to kill, these hulking monstrosities are a ton of fun to use.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/demilich/" target="_blank">Demilich: CR 14</a>
          -- Demiliches are notoriously known as 'the party killer'. Only use this monstrosity against an advanced or overpowered party, or you'll quickly find yourselves rolling up new characters. However, if you want to eliminate a few characters, the Demilich is the way to go.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/chromatic-white/ancient-white-dragon/" target="_blank">Ancient White Dragon: CR 15</a>
          -- It's called Dungeons and DRAGONS, after all. Though there are dragon ages and types for players of all levels, the Ancient White Dragon is a great being for running across a high level party. Dragon Hunting is difficult, but incredibly fun.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/devil/horned/" target="_blank">Horned Devil: CR 16</a>
          -- The heads of armies of devils, Horned Devils are vicious demonic foes that serve as amazing boss fights; there's devils and demons of all levels, but they're incredibly difficult throughout the entire game. Use them carefully!</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/giant-true/giant-rune/" target="_blank">Rune Giant: CR 17</a>
          -- Usually, once you're at this high a Challenge Rating, most creatures will be the most powerful thing in the room; a single Rune Giant could take on a Dragon, but add in the tribal nature of these beasts, and even max level characters will struggle with these infamous destroyers.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oni/oni-water-yai/" target="_blank">Water Yai Oni: CR 18</a>
          -- Going into Eastern fantasy lore rather than Western, Oni are a fantastic way to shake up a campaign. Water Yai are some of the most powerful, but can also make some of the most entertaining antagonists.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/oozes/shoggoth/" target="_blank">Shoggoth: CR 19</a>
          -- Cthulhu has stats, but trust me when I say that the party's not going to fight him. They can, however, try to take down a Shoggoth. Good luck!</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/magical-beasts/spawn-of-destruction/tarrasque/" target="_blank">Tarrasque: 25</a>
          -- The Tarrasque is a one of a kind monster. It only wakes up every few thousand years, has an Intelligence of 2, and is difficult, if not impossible to truly kill. The ultimate killer of parties, the Tarrasque is well-known for being one of the most powerful beings in Pathfinder; short of the gods.</li>
