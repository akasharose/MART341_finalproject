      <h1>Creating Players</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="charactertext">
      <p>There are a three major parts to making a character as a player, and I'll go through them one at a time.</p>
      <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 1.3em;"><b>Finding a Basic Concept</b></li>
          <p>First and foremost, you as a player need to figure out what type of character you want to play. There are three major ways to go about
            doing this. The first method of character concept is to just freeform come up with something. Maybe a pun, or just a character thought. For
            example, if you suddenly think of how cool it would be to play a Legolas like character, spreading arrows all over the place, then you have your basic concept.
            The second is to start with a class you're interested in playing, and build a character thought out of that -- start with your class, and figure
            out what it is that makes your character unique. For example, if you want to play a wizard, what makes your wizard different than every other
            wizard. Hopefully, from this point you can get to the same level of detail that the first method gets the player to. The final way to build a
            character, and my personal favorite, is to find a way to tie the character into the world. Talk to your DM, and ask about the world -- different lands, unique
            factions, and just the kind of people that inhabit the world. From there, find some part of the world, you want your character to connect to, and then
            create a character concept from there -- with your character directly connected to the world, it's much easier for the DM to connect you directly to
            the world around you; often allowing for quests based entirely on your backstory. At the end of this section, you should have a basic character, maybe a class,
            and sometimes a name.</p>
        <li style="font-size: 1.3em;"><b>Honing the Concept</b></li>
          <p>From here, run your character concept past your DM. Once they approve it, you can start to go into much deeper detail with the character. I've been a big fan
            of asking a series of questions; these are my personal favorite ones to learn about your character.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Who was your character raised by? What was their life like? How did their life lead to them becoming an adventurer?</li>
              <li>What does your character do in their free time? Do they have any hobbies? Are they single? Are they married? Do they have a job?</li>
              <li>What is your character afraid of? Is there anything they can't bear to lose?</li>
              <li>How does your character view themselves? How does your character view the world around them? Is there anything they'd change?</li>
              <li>What does your character regret? What would they have done differently earlier in life, if they could.</li>
              <li>What is your character's goals? What do they want short term? Long term? Out of life?</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Talk about all these things with your DM. Figure out characters from your backstory, and check everything with your DM. You should understand your character
            fairly deeply now -- at this point, you and your DM can work together to make your character's stats.</p>
        <li style="font-size: 1.3em;"><b>Character Creation</b></li>
          <p>Making the character sheet is a crucial part of playing Dungeons and Dragons. The first step of creating a character is finding a character sheet. Often,
            your DM will choose a character sheet type for the party, but these are the three main sheets I always recommend.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://zaffudo.com/sebe/Pathfinder%20Roleplaying%20Game/Character%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank">Classic Pathfinder Character Sheet</a>
                -- The Classic Pathfinder Character sheet is simple, and well ordered, but doesn't have much space. If you use this sheet, you'll definitely need to keep a note sheet in addition to the normal character sheet.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.badassbandannastudios.org/downloads" target="_blank">Badbass Bandanna Characer Sheet</a>
                -- The Badass Bandanna sheet is my personal favorite; there's a massive amount of space on the sheet for notes, and the equations are written out in full to make it as simple as possible for the player.</li>
              <li><a href="http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc/" target="_blank">Dyslexic Character Sheet</a>
                -- The Dyslexic sheet is incredibly focused, as there are bonus sheets based upon your class, often with most abilities written down. Much like the first sheet, a notepage is quite helpful.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>After getting a character sheet, the next part is where things get mechanical -- now you roll up stats. There are multiple ways to roll up stats, and your
            DM ends up with the final say. There are point systems to keep characters personally balanced, but the way I like to roll characters to make them powerful
            (the more powerful the party, the more difficult encounters I can throw at them), I have each player roll 5d6 (5 six-sided dice). If they roll any 1's, They
            reroll that die. Then, they add the highest three numbers on the five dice together, giving them a number between 6 and 18. They repeat this seven times, and then
            drop the lowest of those seven rolls. This gives them six numbers -- these will be the character's <b>stats</b>. This simple process can, or course, be changed.
            You can roll 4 or 3 dice instead of 5, you can choose to not reroll 1s, and you can only roll six numbers without dropping the lowest. Either way, the end result needs
            to be six numbers, each no lower than 3 (Rolling three ones) and no higher than 18 (Rolling three sixes). These six numbers can be put in any stat of your choice --
            where you put the stat should be based on your class. The six stats are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strength -- The character's physical prowess. Effects the character's ability to hit and damage with most melee weapons, as well as raw strength for moving large items.</li>
              <li>Dexterity -- The character's mobility. Effects the character's ability to hit with ranged weapons, as well as some melee weapons. Also makes the character dodge more effectively.</li>
              <li>Constitution -- The character's physical endurance. Effects the number of hit points gained each level, as well as the character's resistance of poison and tolerance for drinks.</li>
              <li>Intelligence -- The character's mechanical knowledge. Effects the number of skill points gained each level, as well as providing bonuses to classes which use Intelligence (Wizard, Alchemist).</li>
              <li>Wisdom -- The character's knowledge of the nature of the world. Effects mental defenses, as well as providing bonuses to classes which draw from Wisdom (Druid, Cleric, Monk, etc).</li>
              <li>Charisma -- The character's personal skills. Effects skills involving human interaction, as well as providing bonuses to classes which draw from Charisma (Sorcerer, Bard, etc).</li>
            </ul>
          <p>For stats, a 10 is meant to be 'average' in the world. If the player wishes, they can always lower one of their stats to 10 or lower for roleplaying reasons (if you're playing an idiot, you can lower
            your intelligence). At 10, the character's ability modifier is +0, or neutral. Every two above 10, the modifier goes up by 1. At 12, the modifier is +1. 14, +2. 16, +3. 18, +4, and so on. To reverse,
            when going below 10, as the number drops to every odd number, the ability modifier goes down one. At 9, it's -1. At 7, -2, or so on. Whenever anything draws from one of your stats, the modifier is what you add
            or subtract to whatever you roll.</p>
          <p>From then on, the rest of the character sheet needs to be filled out. Using the resources link at the bottom of the main page, you can choose feats, allot skill points, buy equipment.
            Spend time reading through your classes description and abilities. Every level, you'll have to roll for hit points -- I personally allow my characters to roll for hit points and attempt
            to roll again if they're unsatisfied with the first roll -- but they have to take whatever the second one is. From there, each class goes over what happens each level in detail, from skill
            points to class abilities. Every odd level, every character attains a new feat, and every 4th level (4, 8, 12, etc), the character can increase one of their base stats by 1.</p>
      </ol>
      <p>You should work with your DM at this point to have a character with a detailed backstory and a complete character sheet. Try to understand your characters abilities, and
        don't be afraid to ask questions or do more research on what exactly you can do in and out of combat.</p>
