# MART341_finalproject

I decided that, since I've already done video games half to death and I don't think I have enough material to make a website about myself, so I decided 'why not make a website on one of the few things in this world that I'm not too bad at, Dungeons and Dragons?' Particularly, DMing. I started brainstorming all the major categories I'd need to go into. I came up with;

1. Resources
  * Including links to outside sites for stats on pre-created monsters, combat rules, equipment, and classes.
2. Story
  * Structuring an overall plotline for a campaign.
  * Example Anecdote from my own experience.
  * Expecting your players to derail your story (because players) and how to keep everything moving.
  * Example Anecdote from my own experience.
3. Gameplay
  * Running Combat
  * Roleplaying and Allowing for Character
  * Using Soundtracks to Supplement the Experience.
4. Characters
  * Creating the Player Characters
  * Creating Non-Player Characters
  * Giving Characters Themes

I've had a good deal of experience in Dungeons and Dragons, and writing a run-down for new players could be really, really fun!
