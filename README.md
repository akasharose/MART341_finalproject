# MART341_finalproject

I decided that, since I've already done video games half to death and I don't think I have enough material to make a website about myself, so I decided 'why not make a website on one of the few things in this world that I'm not too bad at, Dungeons and Dragons?' Particularly, DMing. I started brainstorming all the major categories I'd need to go into. I came up with;

1. Resources
  1. Including links to outside sites for stats on pre-created monsters, combat rules, equipment, and classes.
2. Story
  1. Structuring an overall plotline for a campaign.
  2. Example Anecdote from my own experience.
  3. Expecting your players to derail your story (because players) and how to keep everything moving.
  4. Example Anecdote from my own experience.
3. Gameplay
  1. Running Combat
  2. Roleplaying and Allowing for Character
  3. Using Soundtracks to Supplement the Experience.
4. Characters
  1. Creating the Player Characters
  2. Creating Non-Player Characters
  3. Giving Characters Themes

I've had a good deal of experience in Dungeons and Dragons, and writing a run-down for new players could be really, really fun!
