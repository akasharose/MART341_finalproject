          <p>You've probably heard of D&D at some point. It's been around for over 40 years now, and has only been gaining popularity. It's creative and
            personal; it's mathematical and analytical; it's a social game that forces you to understand the people willing to sit around a table for hours
            talking to you. As groups like Critical Role (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-p9lWIhcLQ" target="_blank">voice actors playing DnD</a>) become popular
            and the game now begins to gain popularity, now is a better time than ever to enter the amazing world of Dungeons and Dragons. However, to say
            there's a learning curve is a massive understatment -- so here, I'll be personally walking you through playing in the Pathfinder Roleplaying System.
            It's a recent system, and every resource of the game is available online, completely free. You'll need one person to play as your DM (Dungeon Master),
            and everyone else will take the roles of players. First, I'll go over telling a story, than how to create characters to fill the world. Finally,
            I'll go over the basic mechanics of the game, from the notoriously complicated combat, the struggles of roleplaying, and how to use soundtracks
            to make the game more interesting.</p>

          <p>As a writer, my favorite part of Dungeons and Dragons has always been the storytelling potential. The thing that makes players and Dungeon
            Masters come back to the game, week after week after week, is the stories. People become genuinely interested in where their characters and
            where they NPCs they've taken a liking for are going to end up. However, the best part of the game can also be the hardest -- in Dungeons and
            Dragons, the DM doesn't have full control. The game is a group storytelling experience, which is why groups like Critical Role are so successful.
            In this section, I'll go over some of the tips I've learned on how to create a story as a dungeon master, and how to be a good player to help
            your DM to tell their story.</p>

          <p>The key to any campaign's success is the characters; the player's characters, who wander the wild world created by the Dungeon Master,
            and the Non-Player Characters that motivate many of the party's actions. In this section, I'll go over some of the successful player
            characters I've seen, and some unsuccessful characters -- and what made them work, and what made them not work. Then, I'll go over
            some of the most successful non-player characters that I've used, and then talk about using character themes, or musical accompanyment,
            to deepen the players relationship to their own characters and the characters around them.</p>

          <p>At the end of the day, hypoteticals and plans for story and character only go so far -- gameplay is crucial for making any campaign work.
            In this section, I'll first go over combat, and how best to use the character you've now created, and then how to use Roleplaying during
            gameplay to make the campaign more interesting. Finally, I'll go over how to use soundtracks to improve the entire gameplay experience.</p>

          <p>One of the best things about Pathfinder is that every stat that you want or need are all available online at multiple websites;
            namely <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/" target="_blank">d20pfsrd</a> and <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/" target="_blank">Paizo</a>.
            With these two sites, you already have access to everything you need. In this final section, I'll be showing you exactly where
            all the resources are (through d20pfsrd, my personal favorite of the two), and continue elaborating on where these resources are used.</p>
